# Processing-JLox
My implementation of the Lox Language, after the book: "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom

The book can be found, read and bought here: **https://craftinginterpreters.com**. Personally, I own a physical copy of this and it is the the book I have waited on for 15 years to fill a huge knowledge gap about compilers and co. that I have since skipping compiler class at university. If you haven't had a glimpse yet, go check it out! It's free to read on Robert Nystrom's website!
